        <li>Tickets are $37 after fees for the cheap seats. It's pretty easy to get cheap seats and then just sit wherever once you get in. If you want to come just message me and we'll coordinate the ticket purchase and travel logistics. </li>
        <li>Let's get Taco Bell on the way!</li>
        <li>I really wanna get a Grave Digger squishmallow while I'm there! Any lil contribution to that (or my ticket/gas) would be a great gift! Other than that I prefer not to have material gifts because I live in a 200sq ft bus.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to <strong>bring hearing protection!</strong> I'll be screaming as loudly as possible! (And the engines are LOUD!)</li>
    </ul>
